# predictingNBAnetrating

This project analyzes 25 years of NBA player statistics (1996–2021) to identify which performance metrics most strongly contribute to winning. Using Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn), I cleaned and preprocessed over 12,000 player-seasons, engineered advanced features such as true shooting percentage and usage rate, and trained multiple regression models (linear, Ridge, Lasso) to predict team net rating. Model performance was evaluated with Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and the results highlight which player stats—beyond scoring—are most predictive of positive on-court impact. The findings provide insight into how teams can identify undervalued contributors and make data-driven roster decisions.
